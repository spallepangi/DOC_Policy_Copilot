# Human-Tone Response Update

## Overview
Updated the Missouri DOC Policy Copilot to provide more human-friendly, conversational responses without technical jargon or source citations.

## Changes Made

### Before (Technical/Formal)
```
The grievance process begins with an Informal Resolution Request (IRR) (offender-rulebook.pdf, p. 71). The offender must file this within 15 calendar days of the incident, receiving a response within 40 days (offender-rulebook.pdf, p. 71). If unsatisfied, the offender files a formal grievance within 7 calendar days of signing the IRR response...
```

### After (Human-Friendly)
```
Hey there, let's talk about the grievance process. It's basically a way for inmates to formally complain about things.

First, they try to work things out informally. They talk to the staff in their housing unit or whoever is involved to see if they can solve the problem without paperwork...
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Conversational Tone**
- Starts responses with friendly greetings like "Hey there!"
- Uses casual, warm language
- Sounds like explaining to a friend or family member

### 2. **No Technical Jargon**
- Removed policy codes (like "P6-6.4", "IRR")
- Replaced formal terms with everyday language
- Avoided bureaucratic terminology

### 3. **No Source Citations**
- Eliminated document names and page references
- Removed parenthetical citations
- Clean, uninterrupted flow of information

### 4. **Plain English**
- Simplified complex procedures into easy steps
- Used everyday words instead of official terminology
- Made content accessible to all reading levels

### 5. **Practical Focus**
- Emphasized what people actually need to know
- Broke down processes into simple, actionable steps
- Focused on real-world implications

## Example Comparisons

### Question: "How are disciplinary actions handled?"

**Old Response:**
> The disciplinary process involves several formal procedures as outlined in policy documents. Violations result in hearings conducted within specified timeframes, with sanctions applied according to established guidelines...

**New Response:**
> Hey there! Let's talk about how disciplinary actions are handled.
> 
> If you're an inmate and break a rule, a staff member will talk to you about it. You'll get a chance to explain your side of the story and name anyone who saw what happened. Within a week, you'll have a hearing where you can give more information and present evidence...

## Benefits

1. **More Accessible**: Easier for families, friends, and inmates to understand
2. **Less Intimidating**: Warm tone reduces anxiety about complex processes
3. **Better Comprehension**: Plain language improves understanding
4. **Faster Reading**: No need to parse through citations and jargon
5. **More Engaging**: Conversational style keeps readers interested
