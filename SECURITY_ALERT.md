# ⚠️ URGENT SECURITY ALERT ⚠️

## 🚨 API Key Exposure Detected and Addressed

### What Happened:
- A Gemini API key was accidentally committed to the Git repository in `STREAMLIT_CLOUD_READY.md`
- GitHub's secret scanning detected this exposure and sent an alert email
- The exposed key was: `AIzaSyBvrRJrHv7OqBLQGNqYK2ZSfaFgQKd6SGI`

### ✅ Immediate Actions Taken:
1. **Git History Cleaned**: Used `git filter-branch` to remove API key from repository history
2. **Documentation Fixed**: Removed hardcoded API key from all files
3. **Force Push**: Updated remote repository with cleaned history

### 🚨 CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED FROM USER:

**YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **🔑 REVOKE THE EXPOSED API KEY**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Delete the compromised API key: `AIzaSyBvrRJrHv7OqBLQGNqYK2ZSfaFgQKd6SGI`
   - Generate a new API key

2. **🔒 SECURE THE NEW API KEY**:
   - Update your local `.env` file with the new key
   - Set the new key in Streamlit Cloud environment variables
   - NEVER commit API keys to Git again

3. **🔍 MONITOR FOR MISUSE**:
   - Check your Google Cloud Console for any unusual API usage
   - Monitor billing for unexpected charges

### 🛡️ Prevention Measures Implemented:
- ✅ `.env` file properly ignored by Git
- ✅ `.env.example` template provided for safe sharing
- ✅ Documentation updated to never include actual keys
- ✅ Git history cleaned of sensitive data

### 📋 Next Steps:
1. ✅ Repository is now clean and secure
2. ⚠️ **REVOKE OLD API KEY** (user action required)
3. ⚠️ **GENERATE NEW API KEY** (user action required)
4. ✅ Deploy with new key to Streamlit Cloud

**🔐 Remember: NEVER commit API keys, passwords, or secrets to Git repositories!**

**Always use:**
- Environment variables
- `.env` files (with `.gitignore`)
- Secret management services
- Streamlit Cloud's secure environment variables
